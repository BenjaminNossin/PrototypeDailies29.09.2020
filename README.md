Feel free to open the project, but it has not been done at all with code-efficiency in mind. Be warned ;)

Gameplay :
- Press space bar to charge your throw
- Release when the red dot is inside the green window
- The more you wait, the more strong is your throw... but will you be able to get it still right inside the window ? 

Minor Bug :
- when turning sound on or off, click on the play screen before pressing space bar. Otherwise, the sound resumes to precedent state

And most importantly :
- Any feedback is much appreciated ! You can contact me here : f.malagugini@orange.fr, or on my twitter : @BNossin
